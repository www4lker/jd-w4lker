# How To Edit Your First Draft 
> “Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.” ― Stephen King

Saramäki, Jari. How To Write A Scientific Paper: An Academic Self-Help Guide for PhD Students (p. 78). Edição do Kindle. 


>When you are ready to show your improved draft to others, you can apply a technique that my research group has borrowed from the software industry: Extreme Editing. In the software industry, “Extreme Programming” is one of the fashionable agile techniques, part of which involves programming in pairs. So, edit in pairs!

This is how Extreme Editing works: go to a meeting room with a large enough screen and open the draft on the screen, zooming in so that everyone can easily read the text. Then, go through the text together, paragraph by paragraph and sentence by sentence. Be critical of each word and each sentence; look for sentences that are unclear or those that could be misunderstood. Try to find ways of reducing clutter and shortening sentences. Trim the fat wherever possible. In my group, we jokingly keep a tally of points scored for every word removed. The winner is the one who has most ruthlessly killed the largest number of words that just tagged along, doing no real service to the text.
