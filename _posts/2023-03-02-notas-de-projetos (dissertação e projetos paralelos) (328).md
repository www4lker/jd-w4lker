>Deep fakes are videos or images that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence to make it appear as if someone else is doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say. This can be done by using a technique called "deep learning" to analyze and understand the characteristics of a person's face or voice, and then using that information to create a realistic, but fake, version of that person in a different video or image. Deep fakes can be used for a variety of purposes, both positive and negative, but they have gained notoriety due to their potential use in creating fake videos of people for malicious purposes.
