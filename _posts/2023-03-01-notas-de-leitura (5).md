# The Anatomy of Melancholy Robert Burton (1577–1640) 

## An Idiosyncratic and Indispensable Masterpiece

>“This vast attic of a book is the strangest, funniest, and most consoling work I know.” —Philip Pullman

Robert Burton was a British scholar who spent virtually all of his adult life at Oxford University, first as a student and then as the librarian of Christ Church College. His vast erudition found expression in one of the most bookish books ever written: The Anatomy of Melancholy. Burton and his time used the word “melancholy” in a more specialized sense than we use it today. According to theories dating back to the ancient Greeks, a person’s temperament was determined by the distribution in the body of the four “humors.” These were fluids—blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile—that corresponded respectively to the basic elements of air, water, earth, and fire. When black bile predominated, the resultant temperament was melancholic, the attendant mood one of pensive depression and enduring sadness. Burton, the sedentary bookman, was melancholic himself, and on one level his Anatomy is a serious, encyclopedic attempt to understand melancholy and the various cures that had been proposed for it at one time or another; it has been called the first detailed psychological work in English. On another level, though, the work is a mischievous escapade—an insanely learned scholarly joke. The comedy derives from Burton’s inexhaustible range of reference (more than 1,300 authors are cited) and his unstoppable loquacity (in his final version, there are more than 500,000 words). Weaving a tapestry of quotation, digression, contradiction, and mindful, ceaseless musing, Burton often reaches a pitch of giddy profundity that is nothing short of hilarious. Anthony Burgess called The Anatomy of Melancholy “one of the great comic works of the world,” while Llewelyn Powys, attuned to the author’s peerless style, called it “the greatest work of prose of the greatest period of English prose-writing.” A verbal city that is endlessly fascinating in its attentions and design, Burton’s elaborate construction repays a lifetime’s wandering. The caution and encouragement offered by M. A. Orthofer in the online Complete Review couldn’t be more apt: “Densely packed, it defies reading as it is now generally practised. And yet it is the ultimate book, a volume that one can not but return to over and over, constantly.”
