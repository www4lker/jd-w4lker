>Thoreau also believed we should look to nature, which is full of deep spiritual significance.He sought “to be always on the alert to find God in nature.” He thought of animals, forests, and waterfalls as inherently valuable both for their beauty and their role in the ecosystem. He said he would be very happy “if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state,” for we are likely to find that “nature is worth more even by our modes of valuation than our improvements are.” We can best understand ourselves as a part of nature; we should see ourselves as “nature looking into nature,” rather than an external force or the master of nature. — location: [53]() ^ref-61904

Pessoas atribuem ao sagan a famosa frase somos o universo conhecendo a si mesmos, mas esta filosofia remete a muito tempo atrás, provavelmente aos hindus (que Thoreau lera) - e aqui vemos uma referencia do proprio Thoreau sobre como deveríamos nos relacionar com a natureza: natureza olha natureza.
