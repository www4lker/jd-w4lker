## Primeiro depoimento

>The author, who has had experience with mind-altering substances, is interested in ancient cultures and religions and came across the plant/drug called Soma in the Rig Veda. They decided to try Amanita Muscaria, which is a popular candidate for Soma, and purchased two 28 gram bags of dried Amanita Muscaria from an internet site. They started with small doses, added to chamomile tea, and gradually increased the dosage over time. They experienced mild effects, such as slight euphoria, sweating, salivating, and urinating. The author eventually took a large dose and experienced intense sweating, salivating, and blurred vision but no pleasant hallucinations. They became nauseous and felt like they had been poisoned, but tried to understand the mental images and realized there were things in their life that needed to be fixed.

## Segundo depoimento

>The author is trying Amanita muscaria for the first time, a mushroom that contains muscimol and ibotenic acid. They consumed 6.5 grams of prepared (baked caps and dried skins) Amanita muscaria and experienced effects such as nausea, dizziness, and increased salivating. The author also noted that baking the mushroom before consuming it increases the muscimol levels and makes the Amanita muscaria stronger. The author found the mushroom to have a nice taste, similar to baked french fries. The effects of the mushroom were difficult for the author to communicate and type due to their visuals and cognitive confusion.

## Terceiro depoimento
>The author had three experiences with Amanita muscaria (Fly Agaric), with the first two being less successful using 1 gm and 1.5 gm of X10 extract. They obtained 2 X 25 gm packs of dried extract and decided to take the mushroom on a Sunday in December 2005. They ground the dried mushroom material and mixed it with canned mushroom soup, which they consumed at 1200 hours GMT. They began to feel drowsy and nausious 45 minutes after taking the mushrooms, and went to lie in bed to listen to music. They experienced a loop-like thought cycle, sweating, and an intense spiritual state, feeling like they were moving from lifetime to lifetime. As the trip peaked at 1830 hours GMT, the author went downstairs and called a friend to tell them about the experience. By 2230 hours GMT, the trip had downgraded and the author felt relaxed and refreshed. The next few days, the author felt chilled out at work and had a lower libido, but it came back five days later. The experience was life-changing and awe-inspiring.

## Quarto depoimento

>The author recounts their experiences with Amanita muscaria, a type of mushroom. They have had past experiences with the mushroom, including one where they and a roommate each took three caps and felt high and had vivid dreams, and another where they and two friends each took five caps and felt antsy and ran around a playground. In their most recent experience, they and three friends each took about 5.5 caps of the mushroom and had a more intense and terrifying experience. The author describes feeling disoriented and losing their coordination, and experiencing flickers in their consciousness. They express regret for not taking the mushroom more seriously and not following the standard rules for taking hallucinogens.

## Quinto depoimento

>The author describes their experience consuming Amanita muscaria, a type of psychedelic mushroom, in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of Germany. They had picked the mushrooms in the autumn and were testing different batches to determine proper dosing. They made a tea with 7.5g of the mushrooms and also ate some of the dregs. The onset of effects was quick, with dizziness, drowsiness, stomach discomfort, and slight visual changes occurring within 15 minutes. The author also experienced a typical low-to-mid-dose Amanita high, including being alert and physically active, enjoying music, and having a detached mental state. The peak experience lasted for about 1-1.5 hours and the author was able to fall asleep easily afterwards.
