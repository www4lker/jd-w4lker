One way to understand this passage might be through the analogy of a gardener and a tree. Just as a gardener tends to a tree, providing it with water, sunlight, and nourishment, so too does one friend in this type of relationship support and care for the other. However, rather than feeling indebted to the gardener, the tree itself might feel a sense of obligation to continue growing and flourishing, just as the friend who receives a favor from their companion might feel a desire to return the favor and do something for their friend in return. In both cases, the focus is on supporting and nurturing the well-being of the other, rather than on a sense of obligation or debt.
