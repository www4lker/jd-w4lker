**Sketch the outline of your paper**. Choose the order of presentation for your results. Choose your figures and write first versions of figure captions. For each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), write down the main points and plan their order of appearance. 

**Sketch the paragraphs of your paper.** Follow your outline and transform it into paragraph-sized blocks, so that every paragraph makes one point only. Write down the point of each paragraph, together with bullet points for the paragraph’s contents; you may already want to sketch the key sentences of the paragraph too. List references if they already come to mind.
