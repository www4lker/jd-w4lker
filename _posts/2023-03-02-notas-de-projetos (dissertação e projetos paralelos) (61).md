# How To Write The Results

## Part II: Text 

>“The scientist only imposes two things, namely truth and sincerity, imposes them upon himself and upon other scientists.” ― Erwin Schrödinger

>The lowest layer contains your “pure” results. These are essentially just data: you measured X, here’s what you got. You computed Y, here is a table. The second layer contains direct and unambiguous interpretations of these data: “the distribution of X measured under condition A clearly has a lower mean than when measured under condition B,” or “Y grows faster as a function of time than Z.” And so on. While such statements may already contain the main conclusion, an additional layer of interpretation is usually required to give meaning to the findings.
