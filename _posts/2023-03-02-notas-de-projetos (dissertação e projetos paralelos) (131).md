There has been concern in the media over the past few weeks about ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, and whether it will render certain professions obsolete. However, ChatGPT has been described as "incredibly limited" and not ready to be relied upon for anything important. ChatGPT is a large language model that predicts the most probable next word in a sentence based on its training data, but it does not have a sense of meaning and has been found to give incorrect answers. As a result, coding forum Stack Overflow has banned ChatGPT. Despite this, some have claimed that ChatGPT could lead to the end of college and the education system, and the demise of professions such as journalism and programming.

There has been recent concern about the potential for ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, to replace various jobs, including journalism and education. However, ChatGPT is a large language model that simply predicts the statistically most probable next word in a sentence based on its training data, and therefore lacks meaning. It has also been criticized for being more focused on bullshitting than creativity. The chatbot has been banned by Stack Overflow, a coding forum, due to its low rate of producing correct answers, and it has also been found to rely on template responses, produce factual and technical errors, and produce icon-like responses rather than actual answers when pressed. The hype surrounding ChatGPT has been compared to a similar incident in June where a Google engineer claimed the company's LaMDA large language model was sentient, which was later dismissed by Google executives.

Recent media attention surrounding ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, has raised concerns about its potential to replace various jobs in society, including journalism and education. However, many experts have pointed out that ChatGPT is limited in its capabilities and is not capable of replacing human intelligence. ChatGPT is a large language model that is able to predict the most likely next word in a sentence based on its training data, but it lacks meaning and understanding. Some have argued that the hype surrounding ChatGPT is similar to the hype surrounding "Potemkin AIs," or technologies that are marketed as being algorithmically or automated but are actually powered by humans working under poor conditions. Instead of focusing on chatbots and AI, experts suggest that discussions should center on the ethical implications of large language models and the roles that algorithmic and automated systems should play in society.
