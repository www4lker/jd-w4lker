1. **Choose your key point and main conclusion**. Pick the single most important result that you have. Condense it into one or two sentences. 
	1. A Brave New World: How Hyperculture, Globalization, and Digital Literature are Reshaping Our Future
	2. Globalization, Digital Literature, and the Hyperculture of the 21st Century
	3. The pace of change: how hyperculture, globalization, and digital literature are reshaping our world
	4. Hyperculture in the Digital Age
2. **Choose what else goes in**. Keep only those results that support your key result or illustrate its significance. Categorise the results according to their role. Leave the rest out or tuck them in the Supplementary Information document. 
3. **Write the abstract first**. Follow the hourglass format: broad context, narrower context, exact research question, your solution, implications of your result on your (sub)field, implications of your result in a broader context. 
4. **Draft the title of the manuscript**. Short titles work better; make sure that the title conveys the point of your paper and aligns seamlessly with your abstract.
