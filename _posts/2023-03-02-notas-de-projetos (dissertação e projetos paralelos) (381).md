1. Climate change is a complex issue that is caused by many different factors, not just a few key issues like coal plants, cars, or burping cows.
2. Modern industrial society, as we have constructed it in the last 150 years, is inherently destructive to the planet.
3. Many major polluters, such as landfills, home energy usage, and the production of cars and roads, are rarely talked about in the public debate on climate change.
4. Fixing one small part of the industrial system is not enough, as each part needs its own solution and many solutions are not straightforward.
5. There are many gray areas in the fight against rapid climate change, including the divide between rich and poor.
6. There is a clear connection between a nation's prosperity and its carbon emissions, but it is also true that 63% of global emissions come from lowto middle-income countries.
7. It is difficult to argue that developing countries should protect their primeval forests and invest in solar panels instead of burning wood when they cannot meet the basic needs of significant parts of their population.
8. Cutting back emissions is not a popular demand, especially when the countries making these demands got rich by causing environmental damage in the past.
9. For billions of people, more emissions are a good thing as they provide a way to escape poverty and achieve a comfortable lifestyle.
10. Proposed solutions to climate change often forget about the realities of poverty and the need for affordable housing, leading to unworkable solutions.
