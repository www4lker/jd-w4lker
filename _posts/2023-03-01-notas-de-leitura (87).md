### Netflix’s New Heavy Metal Fantasy Anime Is Unapologetically Horny And That's OK

Isaiah Colbert

"When I first watched Netflix’s new anime _Bastard!!: Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy_, I expected a melodramatic anime series along the lines of [_Record of Lodoss War_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_Lodoss_War). What I got was an unapologetically horny show about a wizard and his ever-growing harem of big-haired anime waifus. I loved every second of it.

_Bastard!!: Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy,_ made by LIDEN FILMS, is a remake of the 1992 anime [_Bastard!! Ankoku no Hakaishin_](https://myanimelist.net/anime/404/Bastard_Ankoku_no_Hakaishin). _Bastard!!!_’s elevator pitch in the _Kotaku_ summer anime guide, which you should totes check out by the by, is that a wizard named Dark Schneider is resurrected to save the kingdom of, I shit you not, Meta-Licana (pronounced Metalicana), from evildoers. However, that description is just the tip of the iceberg for what this horned-up anime has in store."
