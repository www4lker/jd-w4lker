Permanent notes are explanations of a single idea, annotated with metadata about the subject of the note, other notes that note is related to, and the source of the note. You usually write permanent notes using literature notes as your source. You take only the most important ideas from your literature notes, and turn them into singular notes you can connect with other notes. Once you have many permanent notes, you can construct a rough draft for an entire article or book. ==Permanent notes are the ultimate destination within your Zettelkasten for the best ideas you have or come across.== In fact, your permanent notes are your Zettelkasten. The permanent note is the last stop for an idea before you synthesize it into something new.
